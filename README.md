## Install And Configure Laravel Passport
- Laravel Passport provides a full 0Auth2 server implementation for Laravel applications. With it, you can easily generate a personal access token to uniquely identify a currently authenticated user.

- ``` $ composer require laravel/passport ```

- Once the installation is complete, a new migration file containing the tables needed to store clients and access tokens will have been generated for your application. Run the following command to migrate your database:

- ``` $ php artisan migrate ```
- Next, to create the encryption keys needed to generate secured access tokens, run the command below:

- ``` $ php artisan passport:install ```
